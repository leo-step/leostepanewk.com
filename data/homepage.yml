  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am back, after a few days of vacationing with family. Weather was awesome, the beach was
    full of nasty jelly-fish, yuk! All-in-all, life has been good. I hope life has been as
    good for all of you.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My area of focus lies in designing web and mobile products, user research as well as
    leading of design & front-end teams. I enjoy designing and coding the UI as much as
    talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals.

      position: "TrueToForm, CTO"
      content: "Leo consistently impressed me throughout his software engineering internship at TrueToForm, where I was his project manager and mentor. He quickly demonstrated that he has strong technical skills in programming and algorithm development, and that he is an incredibly motivated, fast learner. Over the course of the summer, he added 11 new body measurements which are critical to garment design and construction. By completing our automated set of full body measurements, we were able to launch the TrueToForm open beta program during the summer and acquire our first paying customers."

      position: "Assistant Professor, NYU"
      content: "Leo first reached out to me through LinkedIn as a high school sophomore to inquire about a summer research position in my group. In my conversations with him, he expressed a passion for machine learning, which he developed by developing personal projects and taking online courses. Leo was the perfect fit for an independent research student, and I had the pleasure of having Leo at the NYU AI4CE lab for the next three years. He demonstrated intellectual curiosity, excellence in collaborating with others, and a passion for machine learning. As an undergraduate student with rich research experience and motivation, he has my highest recommendation."
