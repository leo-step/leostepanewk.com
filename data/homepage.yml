  title: "About Me"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    Hi there! I am a computer science student at Princeton who is interested in machine learning, 
    blockchain, and entrepreneurship. I strive to an early adopter of new technology so that I 
    can deliver innovative products to users.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I have experience in machine learning, both in an industry and research setting. 
    I also enjoy building web applications for my projects, university clubs, and internships. 
    Recently, Iâ€™ve delved into Ethereum smart contract programming and auditing.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I am an alumni of the New Jersey Governorâ€™s School of Engineering and Technology, a program 
    for the top 72 engineering students in the state. My team and I published a paper on generative 
    music that was accepted to MIT URTC 2020.
    </p>'
  content2: '<p class="lead">
    In addition, I was a member of the champion team in the 2021 MathWorks Math Modeling (M3) Challenge.
    In a 14-hour window, my team developed mathematical models for predicting usage and distributing 
    resources to improve rural internet accessibility. Our paper was judged by professional mathematicians 
    and was selected to be the best out of hundreds of submissions.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Outside of work, I spend time folding origami chickens, beating my friends at ping-pong (sometimes), 
    and going on long walks outside. Iâ€™ve played tennis since middle school and practiced classical/jazz 
    guitar for over 10 years. I am also a fan of hackathons and various programming challenges.
    </p>'

    - name: "Margaret Tam"
      position: "TrueToForm, CTO"
      content: "Leo consistently impressed me throughout his software engineering internship at TrueToForm, where I was his project manager and mentor. He quickly demonstrated that he has strong technical skills in programming and algorithm development, and that he is an incredibly motivated, fast learner. Over the course of the summer, he added 11 new body measurements which are critical to garment design and construction. By completing our automated set of full body measurements, we were able to launch the TrueToForm open beta program during the summer and acquire our first paying customers."

    - name: "Dr. Chen Feng"
      position: "Assistant Professor, NYU"
      content: "Leo first reached out to me through LinkedIn as a high school sophomore to inquire about a summer research position in my group. In my conversations with him, he expressed a passion for machine learning, which he developed by developing personal projects and taking online courses. Leo was the perfect fit for an independent research student, and I had the pleasure of having Leo at the NYU AI4CE lab for the next three years. He demonstrated intellectual curiosity, excellence in collaborating with others, and a passion for machine learning. As an undergraduate student with rich research experience and motivation, he has my highest recommendation."
