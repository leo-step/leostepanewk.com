  title: "About Me"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    Hi there! I am a computer science student at <span class="bold-orange">Princeton</span> who is interested in <span class="bold-blue">machine learning, 
    blockchain, and entrepreneurship</span>. I strive to an <span class="bold-orange">early adopter</span> of new technology so that I 
    can deliver innovative products to users.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I have experience in machine learning, both in an industry and research setting. 
    I also enjoy building <span class="bold-blue">web applications</span> for my projects, university clubs, and internships. 
    Recently, I‚Äôve delved into <span class="bold-orange">Ethereum</span> smart contract programming and auditing.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I am an alumni of the <span class="bold-blue">New Jersey Governor‚Äôs School of Engineering and Technology</span>, a program 
    for the <span class="bold-orange">top 72 engineering students</span> in the state. My team and I published a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9668909" target="_blank">paper</a> on generative 
    music that was accepted to MIT URTC 2020.
    </p>'
  content2: '<p class="lead">
    In addition, I was a member of the <span class="bold-blue">champion team in the 2021 MathWorks Math Modeling (M3) Challenge</span>.
    In a 14-hour window, my team developed mathematical models for predicting usage and distributing 
    resources to improve rural internet accessibility. Our <a href="https://m3challenge.siam.org/sites/default/files/uploads/CHAMPION_14817.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> was judged by professional mathematicians 
    and was selected to be the <span class="bold-orange">best out of hundreds of submissions</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Outside of work, I spend time folding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWM5PCgmkt8" target="_blank">origami chickens</a>, beating my friends at ping-pong (sometimes), 
    and going on long walks outside. I‚Äôve played tennis since middle school and practiced classical/jazz 
    guitar for over 10 years. I am also a fan of <span class="bold-blue">hackathons</span> and various <span class="bold-orange">programming challenges</span>.
    My teammate and I won the $1000 ‚ÄúBest TigerApp‚Äù prize at <span class="bold-blue">HackPrinceton Spring 2022</span>.

      position: "TrueToForm, CTO"
      content: "Leo consistently impressed me throughout his software engineering internship at TrueToForm, where I was his project manager and mentor. He quickly demonstrated that he has strong technical skills in programming and algorithm development, and that he is an incredibly motivated, fast learner. Over the course of the summer, he added 11 new body measurements which are critical to garment design and construction. By completing our automated set of full body measurements, we were able to launch the TrueToForm open beta program during the summer and acquire our first paying customers."

    - name: "Dr. Chen Feng"
      position: "Assistant Professor, NYU"
      content: "Leo first reached out to me through LinkedIn as a high school sophomore to inquire about a summer research position in my group. In my conversations with him, he expressed a passion for machine learning, which he developed by developing personal projects and taking online courses. Leo was the perfect fit for an independent research student, and I had the pleasure of having Leo at the NYU AI4CE lab for the next three years. He demonstrated intellectual curiosity, excellence in collaborating with others, and a passion for machine learning. As an undergraduate student with rich research experience and motivation, he has my highest recommendation."
